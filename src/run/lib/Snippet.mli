   Extract a snippet from the location in a source file.

(*
   Render a snippet as text. If 'color' is true, the output will use
   color in a manner compatible with an ANSI terminal. Otherwise
   the text to be highlighted is underlined with '^^^'. The latter will
   produce incorrect results on lines containing multi-byte characters.

   Missing newlines are added automatically.
